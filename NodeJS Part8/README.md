## Introduction

In this repository, you will explore the concept of middlewares in Node.js and learn how to implement them in your applications. Middlewares are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the server. They can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware in the stack.

## Topics Covered

### Understanding Middlewares

- **Definition**: Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
- **Purpose**: They are used for various purposes such as logging, authentication, data parsing, and error handling.

### Using `app.use` Middleware

- **Description**: Learn how to use `app.use` to define middleware functions that are executed for every incoming request.
- **Use Case**: Logging request details, parsing JSON data, setting headers, etc.

### Next in Middleware

- **Description**: Understand how to use the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.
- **Use Case**: Ensuring that the next middleware or route handler is executed after the current middleware has completed its task.

### Creating Utility Middlewares

- **Description**: Learn how to create custom utility middlewares that perform specific tasks.
- **Examples**:
  - `req.method`: Logs the HTTP method of the request.
  - `req.hostname`: Logs the hostname of the request.
  - `req.path`: Logs the path of the request.
  - `req.time`: Adds a timestamp to the request.

### Middleware for Specific and All Paths

- **Description**: Learn how to apply middleware to specific routes or to all routes in your application.
- **Use Case**: Applying authentication middleware only to protected routes, or logging middleware to all routes.

### Passing Multiple Middlewares

- **Description**: Understand how to pass multiple middleware functions for a single route.
- **Use Case**: Combining logging, authentication, and data validation middlewares for a single route.

### Handling Errors in Middleware

- **Description**: Learn how to handle errors within middleware functions and pass them to the error-handling middleware.
- **Use Case**: Catching and logging errors, sending error responses to the client, and preventing crashes due to unhandled errors.
