## Introduction

In this repository, you will explore advanced features of Express.js, such as setting up routers, managing cookies and sessions, and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. These topics are essential for building secure and scalable web applications with Node.js.

## Topics Covered

### Express Router

- **Description**: Learn how to modularize your application by using the Express Router. This allows you to split your routes into separate files, making your code more organized and maintainable.
- **Use Case**: Structuring routes for different parts of your application, such as user management, product handling, etc.

### Express Cookies

- **Description**: Understand how to set, retrieve, and manage cookies in your Express applications. Cookies are used to store data on the client-side, which can be used to track user sessions, preferences, and more.
- **Use Case**: Storing small pieces of data on the client side, such as authentication tokens or user preferences.

### Express Sessions

- **Description**: Explore session management in Express. Sessions allow you to store data on the server-side that is persistent across multiple requests from the same user.
- **Use Case**: Keeping track of user login states, storing shopping cart data, and managing user-specific data during a session.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Description**: Dive into the concepts of authentication and authorization in Node.js. Authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization determines what resources the user is allowed to access.
- **Use Case**: Implementing user login systems, securing routes based on user roles, and protecting sensitive data.
