## Introduction

In this repository, you will learn about handling HTTP GET and POST methods in Express.js, including how to handle HTML form submissions using these methods. Additionally, you will delve into the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, enhancing your ability to write modular and reusable code.

## Folder Structure

### Folder 1: Get and Post Request

In this folder, you will learn:

- **Get and Post Methods**: Understand the fundamental differences between GET and POST methods, their use cases, and how to handle them in Express.js.
- **Handling HTML Forms**: Learn how to handle form submissions using GET and POST methods and how to map them to `app.get` and `app.post` methods in an Express.js application.

### Folder 2: JavaScript OOPS

This folder covers:

- **JavaScript OOP Concepts**: Explore the principles of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript, including classes, objects, inheritance and constructor.
- **Practical Examples**: Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript OOP through practical examples and explanations, helping you understand how to implement OOP concepts in your projects.

## Thank You

Thank you for exploring the **NodeJS Part4** repository. We hope this repository helps you gain a deeper understanding of handling HTTP methods in Express.js and JavaScript OOP concepts. Happy coding!
