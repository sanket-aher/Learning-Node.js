## Introduction

In this repository, you will explore advanced error-handling techniques in Node.js using middlewares. Error handling is a crucial aspect of any application, ensuring that errors are caught and handled gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to users, and maintaining the stability of the application.

## Topics Covered

### Throwing Errors

- **Description**: Learn how to throw errors using `throw new Error` within your routes and middlewares.
- **Use Case**: Forcing an error to occur when certain conditions are met, such as invalid input or unauthorized access.

### Using `next()` and `next(err)`

- **Description**: Understand how to pass control to the next middleware or route handler using `next()`, and how to trigger error-handling middleware using `next(err)`.
- **Use Case**: Managing the flow of request handling and directing errors to the appropriate middleware for handling.

### Error Handling Middleware in `app.use`

- **Description**: Learn how to define error-handling middleware using `app.use` to catch and process errors throughout your application.
- **Use Case**: Centralizing error handling, logging errors, and sending error responses to the client.

### Error Handling in Normal Functions

- **Description**: Explore how to handle errors in regular (synchronous) route handlers and middlewares.
- **Use Case**: Catching and responding to errors in synchronous code, preventing application crashes.

### Error Handling in Async Functions

- **Description**: Understand the challenges of handling errors in asynchronous functions, where errors may occur after the initial function call has returned.
- **Use Case**: Managing errors in functions that involve asynchronous operations like database queries or API calls.

### Using `try` and `catch` for Async Functions

- **Description**: Learn how to use `try` and `catch` blocks to handle errors in asynchronous functions.
- **Use Case**: Safely executing asynchronous code and catching errors that may arise during execution.

### Creating a `wrapAsync` Function

- **Description**: Discover how to create a `wrapAsync` function to automatically catch errors in async route handlers and pass them to your error-handling middleware.
- **Use Case**: Simplifying error handling in asynchronous functions by reducing repetitive code and ensuring all errors are properly caught and handled.
